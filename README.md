## Digglet
Digglet searches and lists subdomains from a target(s).

As it finds subdomains it indicates if they are obsolete or still in use.

At the end of the execution you will find a folder with the results obtained: file with all the subdomains, file with the active subdomains and another file with the obsolete subdomains of the target(s).



### Installation

```
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/suraei/digglet.git
$ cd digglet 
$ sudo chmod +x digglet
```

## Usage


```
$ sudo ./digglet -t <domain>|<domainlist>
```
